# Scrape

A tool for analyzing [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) projects / A learning experience.

## Scratch 2.0 File Format

The new Scratch file format is a zip-compressed json file. You can see the example [.sb2 file here](./examples/learning_ai.sb2) and the [upzipped .sb2 file here](./examples/learning_ai.json). These files correspond to [this online Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/124636317/#editor).

## History

The original project was created in [Processing](http://processing.org), an extension of Java for artists. It was used to analyze the projects created by middle-schoolers participating in the experimental [IJIMS](http://www.tcnj.edu/~ijims/ "Interactive Journalism Institute for Middle Schoolers") summer camp.

Since then, Scratch has moved from an offline program with an online community to a fully online experience. Having stopped development in 2011, the change left the Scrape tools and its own community, Happy Analyzing, behind in obsoletion.

The project was open-sourced on November 15th, 2016.
