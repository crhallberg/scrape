Scratch: 1.3 (release of 2-Sep-08)
Notes:
    Yay!! This is a little ditty I came up with for Scratch. It plays by using lists! It's extremely simple, mostly because right now, it's just a test. I want to get this idea out there into the Scratch community so people can start using it! (Adjust the tempo!!)  =)
