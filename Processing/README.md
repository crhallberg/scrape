# Development

This version of the Scrape tool is built in [Processing](http://processing.org), a Java IDE for artists.

# How to Use

To get your OWN Scratch text files analyzed...

## AUTOMAGICALLY

Drag the text files into the program while it is running.

## MANUALLY

1. Open up the `data/input/` folder.
2. Put your text files either directly into the folder OR within a subfolder within input. (If contained in a subfolder, the file icon in Scrape will feature the name of the folder beneath the project title, which is useful for grouping projects.)
3. Mind that files you want to show up in the program MUST be *text* files exported from Scratch. Raw Scratch files (.sb) are too crazy for us to read.

## To convert a Scratch file to a summary *text* file...

1. With Scratch open, hold down SHIFT and click "File". "Write Project Summary" will be an available option.
2. If you just want one Scratch file, click Write Project Summary when the Scratch file you want analyzed is open and choose the path to which to export this text file.
3. If you want a batch of programs converted to text files, choose Write Multiple Project Summaries and choose the directory of the folder that contains all the Scratch files you want churned out as text files. The exported text files should appear in your Scratch folder.
